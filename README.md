# Topaz - A simple FOSS Anti-VPN plugin for Velocity
### Inspired by [egg82's/Laarryy's Anti-VPN plugin](https://github.com/Laarryy/Anti-VPN).

## Installation guide:
You need:
* Velocity 3.1.2+
* Java 17+
* Email address
* A custom plan from GetIPIntel **(required only if you will be making more than 500 requests a day)**

1. Download the plugin from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MrZomka/Topaz/releases).
1. Install the plugin on your Velocity proxy.
1. Start the proxy.
1. In the config file and enter your email, __***OTHERWISE THE PLUGIN WILL NOT WORK!!!***__
1. Restart the proxy.

And you're good to go! :)
