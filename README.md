# Topaz - A simple FOSS Anti-VPN plugin for Velocity
### Inspired by [egg82's/Laarryy's Anti-VPN plugin](https://github.com/Laarryy/Anti-VPN).

## Installation guide:
You need:
* Velocity 3.1.2+
* Java 17+
* Email address
* A custom plan from ProxyCheck.io **(required only if you will be making more than 500 requests a day)**

1. Download the plugin from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MrZomka/Topaz/releases).
1. Install the plugin on your Velocity proxy.
1. Start the proxy.
1. In the config file and enter your API key. (This step is not required but is really recommended!)
1. Restart the proxy.

And you're good to go! :)

## FAQ:
Q: Can I change the clear cache interval?
A: Yeah! Just keep in mind that the interval there is in seconds, not minutes or hours. ;)

Q: My players are getting kicked with an error message! What do I do?
A: Check your logs! It is possible that you just ran out of queries for today!

Q: What are the permissions that Topaz checks for?
A: `topaz.bypass` for the IP quality score check bypass.

Q: What permission plugin do you recommend?
A: [LuckPerms never failed me. :)](https://luckperms.net)
